### Setup Network
#### Step1:
Create a folder **invoice** under **fabric-sample-invoice/**
<br />
Then copy all files under blockchain-training-labs/**node/** in this repository then paste it to the directory
<br />
<br />
**NOTE:** Do not include **node_modules/**

#### Step2:
Create a folder **invoice** under **fabric-sample-invoice/chaincode/**
<br />
Then copy the **go/** folder in this repository or simply create a new folder named **go/** inside **fabric-sample-invoice/chaincode/invoice/** then paste it to the directory
<br />

#### Step3:
Open terminal then change directory to **/fabric-sample-invoice/invoice/**
Then run **./startFabric.sh** -This will  spin up a blockchain network comprising peers, orderers, certificate authorities and more.

Then run **npm install** - Install the Fabric dependencies for the applications.

Then run **node enrollAdmin.js** -  Uses a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) â€” the private and public key are first generated locally and the public key is then sent to the CA which returns an encoded certificate for use by the application.
